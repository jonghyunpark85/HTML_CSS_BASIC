            <strong>Background</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            As already mention, Tesla formerly known as the Tesla motor includes design, develops,
            manufacture and sales their fully electric vehicles.
            According to an officially Tesla automotive website they believe, “the faster the world stops
            relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
            To that accomplish that they are going to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable
            energy”.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Strategy</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            When entering the Tesla website, a new user can interpret to be a shopping site due to all the
            products that’s presented on the first page.

            <br>
            <strong>Usability</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Like any other professional websites, Tesla demonstrates a well-organized site. There is no
            issue finding information that’s users are looking for.
            Although this feature is hidden under the support categories, having a search button/key
            promotes a helpful tool. User has the option to search a question online,
            promoting a quick and easy answer. It’s crucial to keep an update to Tesla website or any other
            professional websites. Not having up to date website can cause slow response pages
            and possibly a broken page.User would rather visit a competitor website than an uncared site.
            Tesla works on any wide variety of browsers,
            from Safari of Apple to Chrome on Microsoft. Beside that the website acts and display equality
            among each browser. With a more hand-held device being used today,
            Tesla mobile site has been tailor and customize to accommodate user view. All personals details
            such as customers private information are deemed secure.
            Making this site safe to purchase.
            <br>

            <br>
            Live chat or web chat is a customer service software that’s help business communicate with their
            visitors. What’s great about this tool,
            it delivers real time interaction and users can use any hand-held devices or a personal computer
            to communicate.

            <strong>Live Chat Helps Generate New Leads</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The use of web chat helps gain leads by gathering data such as demographic information, search
            and purchase history,
            what information user are viewing, and time of the day customer are viewing the website. The
            benefit of collecting data draw insight to visitor behavior patterns,
            that businesses can use to compose a more personalize experience. An establishment of a
            recommendation box is one way to customize the visitor experience.
            A recommendation box can help customers narrow their search, down to their preference. This save
            visitor loads of time because they don’t have to research each and every vehicle.
            However, achieving this it requires personal information of the visitor lifestyle and
            personality, or as previously mention,
            compiling data by how the customer behavior on business website.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Reduce support cost</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            The figure 1 demonstrates call center cost more to operate than Web chat.
            <br>
            The traditional use of a call center involves many call agents handling each individual request
            via the phone or electronic mail. This method is acceptable; however,
            it holds some drawback. Given a situation, where a call center will receive loads of incoming
            calls/emails to the point where it numbers outnumbered the working employees.
            Creating an unwanted situation of calls pile up and unhappy customers being put on hold.
            Recruiting more staff probably what comes to mind when counteract this matter.
            Then again, if the situation were reverse, the business can possibly be losing money because
            they have to pay their employee even though the call center is lacking visitor calls.
            This is where live-chat show its favor. Customer service agents can participate in as many as
            six! simultaneous chats depending on the complexity of the issues involved,
            based on research conducted by TELUS International.

            <strong>Competitive advantage</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            A competitive advantage is where companies can up hold an advantage from their competitors.
            This can be accomplished through the lower cost on products, the new top of the line
            merchandise, better support or services, etc.
            The use of live chat is by far the best communication between customers and businesses.
            A report done by TELUS International found that companies know how beneficial live chat is, but
            are adopting the change. By embodying live chat,
            business can build a more reputably brands because it’s a new tool that no other companies are
            using. Live Believe or not, only 9% of companies are employing this tool,
            according to Steven McDonald. This can be a big game changer because this can be the key to hold
            up an advantage from the other dealership.

            <br>
            <strong>Customer Convenient </strong>
            <br>
            Multiple Languages Support: Communicate is key to a success business, but that proven challenge
            considering there is well over a hundred different language.
            Therefore, to break that language barrier companies will administer multilingual assistant
            speaker.
            <br>
            Queries: Seeing how vehicles is one of the most expensive investment folks will purchase.
            Therefore, it’s important for the live chat agent to answer their countless question.
            <br>
            Respond Time: Digital Market the response time will determine profit or disappointment. Keeping
            a customer happy and giving out information is key.
            According from the graph below Social media takes 10 hours, while email takes a whopping 17
            hours. That is a long time!
            <br>
            The figure 2 indicates customer service response time. Having to wait over 10 hours to get a
            respond is unacceptable.
            For fact, a lot of consumer could lose interest if a respond will take nearly a full day.
            Potential leads can be lost.

            Artificial Intelligence is an option to make a PC, it controlled robot, or a product mind
            closely in a way that can be compared to what smart people think.
            Artificial intelligence practiced what the human mind thought and how it learned, chose and
            worked while trying to deal with certain problems,
            and then used the findings as a premise for creating insightful programming and frameworks.
            Therefore,
            the development of Artificial intelligence began with the goal of creating comparative insights
            in the machines NextGenTech team find and respect in people high.
            The AI target is how to create an expert system which is a framework that provides insightful
            behavior, learning, explanation, clarity and guidance to customers,
            and how to implement human information on machine which is creating a framework as like humans

            significant, paying little respect to the field of business, mastery or calling.
            Topics include AI, probabilistic thinking, an application of autonomy, PC vision and regular
            language processing.
            Make sure Tesla have a clear understanding of what's going on in Tesla’s business and in the
            area of expertise so that Tesla can use the best programming and
            equipment for Tesla’s activities. One of the most important aspects of conducting steady
            activities is to be linked to AI and its administration.

            AI help to improve services through the use of Chat-bot. AI experts have focused on various
            solutions for companies. If Tesla comes into project profits and look available for new
            development,
            Tesla will find improvements that will undoubtedly provide business to consumer. If consumer is
            required to contact Tesla to handle problems they experience with purchased items,
            Tesla can give answers through chat-boats. The administration in which chat-bots embrace
            business is increasingly productive, fast, accurate and concise.
            These chat-bot innovations are also used in addition to meeting booking and ordering
            arrangements that provide the company with the right response to customer requests it receives
            and

            AI is used to enhance security services which prevent cyber security crimes. To improve and improve security
            to ensure connectivity, programmers must realize that they have an estimate to fix Tesla’s security. There
            are a number of things around it that should be possible, such as sending the best answers to the frame's
            assurances. Today, AI is based on the use of observational programs that can be implemented on a daily basis
            in agreements in which numerous organizations are being coordinated. By utilizing AI benefits around them,
            they can save cash and time by taking advantage of process advancement and action improvement measures.

            interactive UI gives Tesla permission to interact with the computer from a human perspective. The
            interactive interface lets the user know what to do with the computer. The interactive UI is more social in
            the way users "contact", "invite", and "message" than traditional apps that have technical characteristics
            that user’s download and install. The interactive interface has aroused corporate interest by providing an
            intelligent interface. Technology giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Google are not only introducing
            Voice Assistant, but also making it a lot smarter. The interface works well across platforms, smartphones
            and smart-watches. The most attractive feature of the interactive interface is how it provides a
            frictionless experience for users of the computer. Interactive UI is evolving into the interface of the
            future.

            <em><strong> conversational UI?</strong></em> Why now? why do NextGenTech team all talk about why Tesla
            creates another
            interaction
            pattern while spending a lot of time tweaking natural behavior in the way that Tesla work with it? The
            choice of customers is having a very high impact on the company's business management policy. Messaging is
            the best digital activity on Earth [Figure 3] - language is the basis of human experience. Throughout
            history, Tesla have repeatedly shown to meet customers or fail to meet challenges where they are. An attempt
            to expand the company to attract people on the other side of all that cooperation is an unsustainable and
            losing battle.

        <p class="paragraph">
            The "UI" of the interactive UI has become consistent. In other words, erosion delivered through advanced
            innovation is fundamentally reduced. The most important sign of this pattern is that cooperation with Voice
            UI (Siri, Alexa, Google Aide) is simple, but information transmission has also improved. (including options
            to include subscriptions, photos, shared areas, shopping, etc.) Sum the number of individuals who must
            abstain from sending messages from public places within days for confirmation.

            <br>
            The figure 4 demonstrates that messaging is a preferred communication channel across the world Digital
            infrastructure and ecosystem for interactive UI are already in the place: Everywhere has mobile, and the
            volume of voice-lighting devices has sky-rocketed. Before the end of 2017, 33 million voice-first devices
            will be installed in U.S. family units alone. Robotized communication hidden in innovation has reached an
            expressive point that can include real value. Frankly speaking, when Siri misheard you're concluding.
            Interactive UI uses typical capacity layouts with large margins on the engine for very long periods of time.

            Set up the above elements together and have an extremely amazing business case for mechanized information
            delivery and voice connectivity: individuals emphatically favor organizations the message, and the
            innovation is developing to react all at once. The most 'customer confronting' ventures (retail,
            neighborliness, travel, and retail banking) are reacting to these inclinations.
            <br>
            <br>
            Creating auto-interactive UI functionality is basically building a 'brain' that can be generated by
            extracting useful information (trade, the customer’s history, inventory and product attributes), from
            Tesla’s enterprise and perform inputs (consumer lookups), output (actual solution, not answer) and produce
            it. Over time, a lot of effort is required, and early-starting companies are developing self-improvement
            technologies that continually add new features and values. It's a good idea to define a narrow use case to
            build a prototype that will provide immediate, incremental value, and test in a focused and measurable way.

            A chat-bot is a conversational bit of programming controlled by pre-modified reactions or AI to respond to
            inquiries without the need of a human administrator. It takes on numerous names. Chat-bot [Figure 5],
            intelligent operator, remote helper, and the conversational interface are only a couple of them. While the
            names may vary, the sole motivation behind these bots continues as before – responding to questions rapidly
            and proficiently. However, chat-bots are special. In addition to the fact that they are ready to answer
            questions, however, they can do as such without the assistance of a human agent. This saves significant time
            and sets aside businesses money. Bots powered by artificial intelligence software (AI) are more
            unpredictable than rule-based chat-bots. These bots are dynamic and don't depend accessible as needs be
            to-activity catches to delineate discussions with their guests. There are really two kinds of Artificial
            intelligence bots. Why are businesses using chat-bots? Chat-bots aren't only valuable for web-site guests,
            application clients, consumers, yet organizations too. Here are a couple of reasons why
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Figure 5: Chat-bot</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="paragraph">
            More individuals are ready to use chat-bots: A joint report by Float, Salesforce and SurveyMonkey found that
            69 percent of buyers really lean toward using chat-bots for quick correspondence with brands. On Facebook
            alone, in excess of 8 billion messages have just been traded among people and bots. Individuals are before
            their PC and telephone screens now like never before, so it just bodes well to furnish them with an
            assistance they can access with their fingertips.
            <br>
            <br>
            Chat-bots give all day, every day administration: Another advantage chat-bots give is a moment
            administration whenever, anyplace. Keep in mind, bots are not obliged to customary work hours or time zones.
            Along these lines, if a client moves toward the bot with a fundamental issue at 3 am, it very well may be
            settled inside minutes. Research gives us chat-bots are poised to spare organizations around $8 billion in
            profitability by 2022. That by itself is sufficient motivation to consider chat-bots.
            Chat-bots are extraordinary at securing client data: These benefits apply more to chat-bots that are used
            for promotional or trading purposes. Chat-bots can be utilized to sign guests in the mood for promoting
            pamphlets, online courses, plan arrangements, and even guide clients to a point of arrival or web-based
            business webpage to settle exchanges. In any case, for a guest to tap the advantages of a chat-bot, they'll
            have to give some essential data like name and email-address, and now and again telephone number and area.
            This data is then consequently put away in an inside database, and the client can be retargeted whenever.
            Simply think, this is all being managed without the exertion of an agent.
            <br>
            <br>
            Types of chat-bots & popular chat-bot: Depending on how a particular boat has been modified, NextGenTech
            team can divide them into two large gatherings: working on pre-planned instructions (basic chat-bot) and
            being prepared (shrewd or progressive chat-bot). First one is basic chat-bots. Relying on pre-compiled
            catchphrases they understand all these directions should be constructed independently by engineers using
            common expressions or testing of various types of strings. If it is possible that a customer has raised an
            investigation without using arbitrary monitoring words, the robot cannot receive it, and responds with
            messages such as "I'm sorry, I didn't understand" when in doubt. Last one is Progressive chat-bots. They
            rely on computerized reasoning when talking to customers. Robots respond with sufficient suggestions on the
            subject rather than predetermined answers. Moreover, every word the clients say is recorded for later
            processing. In any case, the Forrester report "The State of Chats" suggests that man-made rituals are
            nothing but magic, and that they are not yet ready to provide a grand encounter only to their customers. In
            fact, it takes a lot of work.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, there are other web crawlers for boats, such as Chatbottle, Botlist, and Teisabotforthat,
            helping designers advise customers about dispatching new chat-bots. These areas also provide the location of
            boats by the number of tables, customer insights, steps, categorization (expedition, effectiveness, social
            connections, internet business, transitions, etc.). Included are more than 35,000 boats for “Facebook
            Messenger, Slack, Skype and Kick”. Tesla can find interesting applications for all categories through
            chat-bot web crawler. For instance, the best chat-bot for Facebook Messenger is “Poncho”. It sends
            individual climate figures with jokes and funny images, and along this line, it looks more like a
            meteorologist colleague than a help to reveal a brutal climate.

            <em><strong>Facebook for Business:</strong></em> Currently, Tesla Facebook page has 159,352 follower and
            147, 837 likes. This
            page
            provides proper material of Tesla’s cars, and links leading to the official website which helps potential
            customers making purchase or giving them in-depth knowledge on cars they are looking to buy. Also, this page
            provides community pages which the followers can share essential knowledge regarding Tesla and express the
            way they feel about it. If a customer wishes to get in contact with Tesla, the contact info which included
            the page will guide followers to a proper way to communicate with them. Moreover, this page provided videos,
            so if the followers would want to see Tesla cars in action, by providing a video Tesla are exhibiting how
            the car may work if they choose to purchase it. This will potentially attract customers or keep followers
            interested in more. Furthermore, it has a feedback system, so the best way to ask followers, how Tesla can
            improve is to have a feedback system. This can address the issues Tesla’s customer can potentially have with
            their product.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, Tesla representatives to accommodate for unsatisfied customers. There are numerous
            consumers that are expressing their predicaments on the comments, but no one has helped or attempted to
            handle their situation. Responding to followers enforces that Tesla take value in the customer and in Tesla
            products. Also, this page should add visual appeal for esthetics purposes, Tesla needs to a cover photo that
            is pleasing to the audience’s eyes. Compared to their counterpart BMW, their cover photo is esthetically
            pleasing, which in the result to attract potential customers. In addition, this page is not posting
            consistently. It is an essential to keep Facebook followers updated on announcements and current events, to
            drive their interest. Especially since Facebook applies to an older audience, that will most likely be
            potential buyers.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em><strong>Instagram:</strong></em> Now, Instagram of Tesla has 6.8M followers and 644 posts. This
            Instagram page provides a
            link to
            Tesla official website, so the followers can access the official dealership website easily. Also, this page
            brief description in their media about their material, so followers have a brief idea what Tesla products
            are about. Moreover, this page shared numerous videos of their products in a creative, funny, interesting
            approach. However, this page needs to advertise their cars more on Instagram such as photos, videos or
            design. Also, this Need to provide stories on their Instagram. It means this page keeps Instagram followers
            interested continually. Furthermore, Tesla Instagram Ask their followers to #repost their vehicles. Asking
            followers for a repost (i.e. #TeslaRepost) with them and their product can lead to larger following and
            potential customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em><strong> YouTube: </strong></em> Their YouTube channel has an extensive number of 1.14m subscribers and
            89,589, 925 views.
            Tesla’s YouTube page displays Links, of their other social media pages such as, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn
            and
            their official website, this is beneficial on Tesla’s part because this will give their followers a chance
            to explore their media and have a deeper understanding of Tesla and their output. Another great aspect of
            their YouTube channel is that they have a playlist of their customer’s stories. This gives their customer a
            chance to speak about how their Tesla vehicles had impact their lives and give them the chance to tell their
            engaging story how they use their Tesla vehicles in their everyday life. Although their YouTube channel may
            have strengths, they also have weaknesses. For starters they need to provide supporting channels of their
            product on them relates. That way they can expand more on their media in YouTube. Secondly, they need how-to
            videos on their list, to guide customers in need. For example, one their rival companies, BMW has helpful
            videos such as “Download and install a Remote Software upgrade with the BMW connected App” Tesla should
            upload videos like that to accommodate to their customers. Lastly, Tesla should post more content. Analyzing
            their YouTube channel, it seems that they only post 2-3 times a month. To keep give their loyal followers
            interested they provide content of updates and other videos to also attract potential customers by providing
            numerous information of their product in sharing their content.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em><strong> Twitter: </strong></em> Tesla's twitter account is one of their most successful social media
            platforms by having
            the number
            of 4.5M followers and acquiring more followers compared to other dealership companies in Twitter. Ex: BMW –
            2M followers, Mercedes-Benz - 3.4M followers, Maserati – 1M followers. The benefits that their twitter is a
            direct e-mail system, which is very useful for benefiting customer and company interaction. Q&A’s of their
            products, another great way of communication and acknowledgement for customers, and customers have a chance
            to learn more about a product Tesla initiated by speaking with a professional associate. presented a link to
            their official dealership, Twitter followers can access their dealership with ease. A link to expand their
            community. Tesla welcomes their new followers to become potential associates for Tesla, which is a good way
            to enforce their campaign. Lastly, Tesla post more in their twitter account compared to their other social
            media platforms which is sufficiently acceptable as long as they’re pertaining to their followers. One thing
            is that Tesla should add is links from their other social media platform since they have such a large
            following in twitter.

            <br>
            Keywords: Compose a segment for 5 keywords for the page. Classifying it on the page can help
            optimize other components
            <br>
            <br>
            Page title: In search engines they analyze the page title. Page title must differentiate from the
            others and must include essential keywords for the page. The tile must be compelling to trigger
            about 60 characters or below. Words during the beginning should include SEO before the ones after,
            this is to initialize the title with Tesla own keyword.
            <br>
            <br>
            Page description: Every search engine shows a description beneath the page title to guide searchers
            on what link is best they should click on. Page description is essential because it determines
            whether a user should click on link or someone else's. When creating a description make sure it
            stands from the rest and shouldn’t be if 160 characters.
            <br>
            <br>
            Headings: In the code of the website, headings are h1 to h6. These identify simply the size in
            the headings as they tend to the reader. H1 is the largest and H6 the smallest among these
            six heading levels. The headings are nothing but shortcuts to adjust the text's size and
            face easily. NextGenTech team says the keywords in headings are more relevant to the search
            engines. This is a great chance to use the keywords Tesla like to use. Recollect, one and
            only one header of H1 per page must be used. That's Tesla’s own main name, for Tesla’s most
            significant keyword should be included. Then Tesla can scatter all text from most essential
            and other keywords. But don't exaggerate this.
            <br>
            <br>
            URL structure: URLs must have the most imperative keyword for the page. Always remember that it is
            essential to avoid using strings of characters in URLs that don’t make sense to visitors. Only use
            lower-case letters and numbers, also dashes should replace spaces. The URL is defined as the
            address, the words on the URL transmits a powerful signal to the search engine of the page.
            Understand that the URL is the most essential keyword on that page. Avoid strings of characters that
            will confuse the user. It is recommended to use lower-case letters, numbers and dashes.

            programmer.
            <br>

            <em>Companies Benefits</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            When companies’ sell their products or services, some will give a brief description of its purpose and what
            to expect. However, since companies only outline the positive aspect, people will still feel untrustworthy.
            This is where a review page can fix this issue. Review page helps potential buyer provide insight of the
            product or services from user experiences who obtained or used it. According to survey done by Bright Local,
            roughly 88% of people rely on online review then what companies advertise message. 88% is such a high
            number, of people taking in mind of reviews. If this product becomes a success, businesses can look forward
            to an inflation of sale, profit, traffics, and leads. According to the figure 6, it reported 72% of customer
            would shop without hesitation at a local business with a positive review. In additional with the same graph,
            shows 31% of customers will buy more if the review is “excellent”. There are a lot of products and services
            on the market that does the same purpose. Making the decision making difficult on the consumers. This is
            where positive review help stand out the best from the rest. Like from the graph, the best service or
            product promote more attention on the market which can build a trustworthy brand to where the customer will
            spend more.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Help to understand customers</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            When rolling out a very new product or services, there’s prone to be flaws. To release a better generation
            than the last, companies are going to need some insight. Online review, is by far the best solution to that.
            By hearing opinions and voices of people negative or positive feedback of the product or services, companies
            can improve it on the next. Otherwise, business will be bad if they did the complete opposite.

            persuade visitor into becoming potential leads. To eyes of the CEO or higher post of Tesla might think their
            websites has reach their full potential. However, NenGenTech team think there can more to do on the Tesla

            5. Moderators, to respond to customer feedback customer and aid customers in all social media platforms.
            <br>
            6. Advertisements that correlate to current trends; Tesla can use current trends to enforce their campaign
