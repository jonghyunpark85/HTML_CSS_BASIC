                        Live chat or web chat is a customer service software that’s help business communicate with their
                        visitors. What’s great about this tool,
                        it delivers real time interaction and users can use any hand-held devices or a personal computer
                        to communicate.

                    <h3>Live Chat Helps Generate New Leads</h3>
                    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.0em;">
                        The use of web chat helps gain leads by gathering data such as demographic information, search
                        and purchase history,
                        what information user are viewing, and time of the day customer are viewing the website. The
                        benefit of collecting data draw insight to visitor behavior patterns,
                        that businesses can use to compose a more personalize experience. An establishment of a
                        recommendation box is one way to customize the visitor experience.
                        A recommendation box can help customers narrow their search, down to their preference. This save
                        visitor loads of time because they don’t have to research each and every vehicle.
                        However, achieving this it requires personal information of the visitor lifestyle and
                        personality, or as previously mention,
                        compiling data by how the customer behavior on business website.

                        The figure 1 demonstrates call center cost more to operate than Web chat.

                        The traditional use of a call center involves many call agents handling each individual request
                        via the phone or electronic mail. This method is acceptable; however,
                        it holds some drawback. Given a situation, where a call center will receive loads of incoming
                        calls/emails to the point where it numbers outnumbered the working employees.
                        Creating an unwanted situation of calls pile up and unhappy customers being put on hold.
                        Recruiting more staff probably what comes to mind when counteract this matter.
                        Then again, if the situation were reverse, the business can possibly be losing money because
                        they have to pay their employee even though the call center is lacking visitor calls.
                        This is where live-chat show its favor. Customer service agents can participate in as many as
                        six! simultaneous chats depending on the complexity of the issues involved,
                        based on research conducted by TELUS International.
