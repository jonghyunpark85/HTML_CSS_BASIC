                        considering there is well over a hundred different language.

                        speaker.

                        Respond Time: Digital Market the response time will determine profit or disappointment. Keeping
                        a customer happy and giving out information is key.
                        According from the graph below Social media takes 10 hours, while email takes a whopping 17
                        hours. That is a long time!
